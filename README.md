---------------------

Description of Command Shell 

- Basic and limited terminal

- Executes user's command input 

+ Does not read in or execute comments following # symbol

- Accepts Command Chaining 'echo name && mkdir test ; ls'

  + '&&': Executes previous then the latter command if previous is successful

  + '||': Executes following command only if the previous fails

  + ';' : Executes following command no matter what

+ Displays error messages if failed execution at any point

- Added test command implementation, runs with keyword "test" or the bracket symbols as well

   + flag "-e" to check if the file or directory exists (default flag)
   + flag "-f" to check if the file or directory exists and is a regular file
   + flag "-d" to check if the file or directory exists and is a directory
   + example: "test -e Test.h" or "[ Command.h ]
   + Command chaining is compatible
   + "test -e main.cpp && echo taco"
   
- Use of precedence using parentheses

- Separate sets can be used "(echo hello && echo name) || (echo world && echo llama)"

- Nested parentheses can be used "(echo hey && (echo this || echo yes))"

- Exits the terminal using the command 'exit'


- Added cd command implementation
  + may use cd, cd -, or cd path


# Known Bugs
- The command following || is not executed if the first command is not recognize 

- Include quotation marks when echoing

- No variations of the word exit can be used 'Exit' or 'EXIT'

- No built in bash commands work

- Commands are still executed if user enters single connectors '&' '|'
